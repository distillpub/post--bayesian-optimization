      We are increasingly getting used to deep(er) neural networks! These networks often come with a huge number of hyperparameters: like the number of layers, the dropout rate, the learning rate, among others. How do we efficiently tune these
      hyperparameters to optimize our machine learning model? In this
      article, we will talk about Bayesian Optimization (BO) - which is an effective suite of techniques often used to efficiently tune the hyperparameters. Besides being used in tuning hyperparameters, BO is a general suite of techniques for
      optimizing a black-box function.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we talk in depth about Bayesian Optimization and its applicability in hyperparameter tuning, we will look into maximizing (optimizing) a black box function!

    <h1 id="mininggold">Mining Gold!</h1>
    <p>
      Let us start the discussion about mining gold. Our goal is to mine goal in a new land. For now, let us make a simplifying assumption, the gold content lies in a one-dimensional space, i.e., we are talking gold distribution only about a line.
      Our aim is to find the location along this line where we would get maximum returns and drill at that location. Now, at the start of the activity, we have no idea about the amount of gold at different locations.
      The only way we can get the information about the amount of gold is by drilling at different locations.
      This drilling is costly and involves expensive sensors to be used.
      We, therefore, want to <strong>minimize the number of drillings required</strong> while still being able to <strong>quickly find location of maximum gold</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We below show two common objectives for the gold mining problem.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Problem 1: Best Estimate of Gold Distribution</strong><br />
          In this problem, we will estimate the amount of gold on the one-dimensional line. But, we can not drill at every location. We should drill at those locations that provide us the <strong>maximum information</strong> about the distribution of
          the gold.
          This problem is akin to <strong>Active Learning<d-cite key="settles2009active,Tong2001"></d-cite></strong>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Problem 2: Location of Maximum Gold</strong><br />
          In this problem, we will find the location in the one-dimensional space where the gold quantity is the maximum. This problem focuses on finding the location with the most gold content. This problem is akin to <strong>Bayesian
            Optimization<d-cite key="humanOut,nandoBOtut"></d-cite>.</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In this article, we will soon see how the two problems are related, but, not the same.
    </p>



    <h2 id="activelearning">Active Learning</h2>

      <p>
        In machine learning problems, often, unlabelled data is very easily available, but labeling could be an expensive task. As an example, for a speech-to-text task, the ground truth labeling or annotation task requires expert(s) to manually
        label words and sentences. In our gold mining problem, drilling (akin to labelling) is an expensive operation, and we would like to minimize it. But, without drilling, we can not estimate the gold estimate.
        Active learning would solve this problem by posing a smart strategy to choose the next drilling site. While there are various methods and techniques in the active learning literature, for the sake of brevity, we will look only at
        <strong>uncertainty reduction</strong>, which chooses the next query point as the one our model is the most uncertain about. One of the ways we can reduce the uncertainty is by choosing the point at which we have the maximum variance (we are
        most uncertain).
        We will now look into Gaussian Processes, which not only give us predictions, but also uncertainty estimates, which will be useful for active learning.
      </p>

      <h3 id="gaussianprocesses">Gaussian Processes</h3>

        <p>
          One might want to look at this excellent distillpub article<d-cite key="görtler2019a"></d-cite> on Gaussian Processes<d-cite key="Rasmussen2004"></d-cite>.
          We will be using Gaussian Processes regression to model the gold distribution along the one-dimensional line. By using Gaussian processes, we take some naive assumption that the gold distribution of nearby points is similar (smoothness).
          Such an assumption is usually true.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let us now try to see how our groundtruth function <d-math>f(x)</d-math> looks like. The gold distribution in our data looks to be bi-modal with a maximum value around <d-math>x = 5</d-math>. For now, let us not worry about the X-axis or the Y-axis units.
        </p>
        <figure class="smaller-img">

        </figure>


        <h4 id="priormodel">Prior Model</h4>

          <p>
            We will choose a simple prior about the gold content along the one-dimensional space. Our prior assumes a smooth relationship between points via a Matern kernel<d-footnote>See <a href="http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/">Rasmussen and
                Williams 2004</a> and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels.Matern.html">scikit-learn</a>, for details regarding the Matern kernel.</d-footnote>. The black line in the graph below
            denotes the knowledge we have about the gold content without drilling even at a single location.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/prior.svg" /></d-figure>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Also, take notice that the confidence (uncertainty) about the gold content is also the same for every location.
          </p>

          <h4 id="addingtrainingdata">Adding Training Data</h4>

          <p>
            Let us now add a point to the train set or in other words, drill one of the locations and see the gold content (<d-math>y</d-math>). We can see how our confidence and our estimates change after we get this first
            information by fitting the model to the new data. We are going to add <d-math>(x = 0.5, \ y = f(0.5))</d-math> into the train set now.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/posterior.svg" /></d-figure>
          </figure>

          <p>
            We see now that the posterior (shown as our prediction) has changed and we are very certain about the gold content in the vicinity of <d-math>x = 0.5</d-math>, but, very uncertain far away from it. Also, we can see that
            the mean of the point
            closer to <d-math>x = 0.5</d-math> is closer to the value that we got from drilling and seeing the gold content. So, we now come to the key idea of active learning:
          </p>

          <h3 id="activelearningprocedure">Active Learning Procedure
        </h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Choose the point of having the highest uncertainty</li>
          <li>Add the point to train set</li>
          <li>Train on the new train set</li>
          <li>Go to #1 till convergence or budget elapsed</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Let us now automate this process and see how our posterior changes at every iteration (after each drilling). For each of our iteration below, the prior was the Gaussian Process learned on the points already in the training set.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/active-gp.gif" /></d-figure>
        </figure>

        <p>
          One point to notice is that this idea of choosing the most uncertain location leads to querying of the points that are the farthest (visible when we choose the
          2nd location to drill). Through this animation, we can notice that just in a few iterations, we are able to estimate the true distribution of gold. At every iteration, our active learning procedure carries out an <strong> exploration
          </strong> to make our estimates better.
        </p>

        <h2 id="bayesianoptimization">Bayesian Optimization</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem 2</strong> requires us to find the location where the gold content is maximum. Even though the problem setting may be similar, the objective is quite different than Problem 1. In other words, we just want the location where we
        can drill to get the most gold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Older problem - Earlier in the active learning problem, our motivation for drilling at locations was to predict the distribution of the gold content over all the locations in the one-dimensional line. We, therefore, had chosen the next
        location to drill where we had maximum uncertainty about our estimate.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this problem, we are instead interested to know the location at which we find the maximum gold. For getting the location of maximum gold content, we might want to drill at the location where predicted mean is the highest, i.e. to
        <strong>exploit</strong>. But unfortunately our mean is not always accurate, so we need to correct our mean which can be done by reducing variance or <strong>exploration</strong>. Bayesian Optimization looks at both
        <strong>exploitation</strong> and <strong>exploration</strong>, whereas in the case of Active Learning Problem, we only cared
        about <strong>exploration</strong>.
      </p>


      <h3 id="acquisitionfunctions">Acquisition Functions</h3>

      <p>
        Now, to take into account the combination of exploration and exploitation, we try to use a function which combines the two sides. These utility functions are called acquisition functions.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can write a general form of an acquisition function (<d-math>\alpha(x)</d-math>) as a function of the mean(<d-math>\mu(x)</d-math>) and the variance(<d-math>\sigma(x)</d-math>), which is in turn specifying that <d-math>\alpha(x)
        </d-math> is a function of exploration and exploitation.
        <d-math block>
          <!-- class="l-middle.side" -->
          \alpha(x) = g(\mu(x), \sigma(x))
        </d-math>
        At each iteration, we would recompute
        <d-math>\alpha(x) </d-math> and choose the location
        <d-math> x^* = _\text{argmax}\alpha(x)</d-math>
        as the next location/point to query.
      </p>

      <h3 id="upperconf"> Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) </h3>

      <p>
        Let us now look into one such trivial acquisition function that linearly combines the exploration/exploitation tradeoff.
        <d-math block>\alpha(x) = \mu(x) + \lambda \times \sigma(x)</d-math>
      </p>

      <figure>
        <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/acq_fn.svg" /></d-figure>
      </figure>

      <p>
        In the figure above, we can see an instantiation of the above-mentioned acquisition function (shown in green) for some value of <d-math>\lambda</d-math>.
        We can observe that mean near the location (predicted) of the just added point (red point) is high. Also, as we go far from the red point, we see that our uncertainty increases to a maximum. We can see that the acquisition function is low at
        the sampled point (part of the train set), as there is no uncertainty at the point. However, as we move away from the red point, our variance increases, and so does our acquisition function. But, beyond a certain value, the acquisition
        function keeps on decreasing. This is because while the variance or uncertainty is high for such points, the posterior mean is low.

        We see at around the location
        <d-math>x = 1.4</d-math>
        we get the maximum value for the acquisition (green curve). Thus we next select this location to drill.
      </p>

      <p>
        The intuition of using the acquisition function <d-math>\alpha(x) = \mu(x) + \lambda \times \sigma(x)</d-math> is that we are interested in finding the global mean <d-math>\mu</d-math>, so taking into account the estimated mean would be a
        good idea.
        Additionally, we would like to explore too (using <d-math>\sigma</d-math>); else we might be stuck in a local maxima if don't explore enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us now try different values of <d-math>\lambda</d-math> and see the maximum gold count found by our acquisition function.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/mab-gp-1.gif" /></d-figure>
      </figure>

      <p>
        For <d-math>\lambda=1</d-math> as shown in the above animation, we can see that we get stuck in the local maxima. This probably means that we are not exploring enough and only exploiting near the current maxima.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/mab-gp-5.gif" /></d-figure>
      </figure>

      <p>
        For <d-math>\lambda=5</d-math> as shown in the above animation, we can see that we still get stuck in the local maxima. Let us now increase <d-math>\lambda</d-math> even more.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/mab-gp-10.gif" /></d-figure>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Perfect! We see that setting this value of <d-math>\lambda=10</d-math> resulted in finding points near the global maxima and not getting stuck in a local maximum.
      </p>

      <h3 id="probabilityofimprovementpi">Probability of Improvement (PI)</h3>

      <p>
        Let us look into our next method for the MAB maximization problem. As before, we want to balance or trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The idea behind the algorithm is fairly simple - choose the next point as the one which has
        the highest probability of improvement over the current max <d-math>f(x^+)</d-math>, where <d-math> x^+ = argmax_{x_i \in x_{1:t}}f(x_i)</d-math> and <d-math>x_i</d-math> is the location queried at <d-math>i^{th}</d-math> time step.
      </p>

      <p>Let us understand this concept in two cases:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            We have two points of similar means (of function values (gold in our case)). We now want to choose one of these to obtain the labels or values. We will choose the one with higher variance. This basically says that <strong>given same
              exploitability, we choose the one with higher exploration value</strong>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We have two points having the same variance. We would now choose the point with the higher mean. This basically says that <strong>given the same explorability, we will choose the one with higher exploitation value</strong>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <d-math>f(x^+)</d-math> be the current highest value of the function
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <d-math>\epsilon</d-math> be close to zero
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Choose <d-math>x_{t+1} = argmax(\alpha_{PI}(x))</d-math> where <d-math>\alpha_{PI}(x) = P(f(x)) \geq (f(x^+) +\epsilon)</d-math>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This can be given as:
      </p>
        <d-math block>x_{t+1} = argmax_x \Phi(\frac{\mu_t(x) - f(x^+) - \epsilon}{\sigma_t(x)})</d-math>
      <p>
        where <d-math>\Phi(\cdot)</d-math> indicates the CDF.
      </p>


      <h4 id="intuitionbehindtheformula">Intuition behind PI</h4>

      <p>
        Below is a graph that helps to visualize how the PI values are calculated. We have calculated <d-math>\alpha_{PI}(x)</d-math> for three points <d-math>x \in \{0.10, 0.6, 4\}</d-math>. We can see the CDF being
        shaded in the graphs below. Further, we can see if we increase <d-math>\epsilon</d-math>, we implicitly place more importance to the uncertainty of a point. If <d-math>\epsilon</d-math> is increased, the points with a larger sigma will
        benefit as their probability density is spread more. Thus points with more spread out sigma would have a higher value of cumulative density function on same <d-math>f(x^+) + \epsilon</d-math>.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/pi_cdf.gif" /></d-figure>
      </figure>

      <p>
        <d-math>f(x^+)</d-math> refers to the maximum functional value, as described earlier.
        We see that the probability of improvement values are calculated by finding the functional value of the cumulative density function at <d-math>f(x^+)</d-math>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now we possess the intuition behind how Probability of Improvement is calculated, now let us change <d-math>\epsilon</d-math> and look at its effects.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/mab-gp-pi-eps0.01.gif" /></d-figure>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Looking at the graph above we can see that we are not effectively exploring at value <d-math>\epsilon = 0.01</d-math> for the Probability of Improvement acquisition function. We are stuck.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/mab-gp-pi-eps0.5.gif" /></d-figure>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Looking above, we see increasing the value to <d-math>\epsilon = 1</d-math>, enables us to explore more and get to the maximum value. One can notice that the
        predicted
        values where <d-math>x \in [3, 4.5]</d-math> posses high uncertainty (can be identified by the grey translucent area, but as we remember we are not interested in getting the best prediction of the gold distribution, we only care about
        the
        maximum value that we can achieve, which this acquisition function with given hyperparameters is able to capture nicely!
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us look at what happens if we increase the hyperparameter <d-math>\epsilon</d-math> a bit more.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/mab-gp-pi-eps3.gif" /></d-figure>
      </figure>
      <p>
        We see that we made things worse! Our model now uses <d-math>\epsilon = 8</d-math>, which has effectively resulted in way too much exploration. This amount of exploration is not able to exploit when we land somewhere near a global maximum.
      </p>

      <h3 id="expectedimprovementei">Expected Improvement (EI)</h3>

      <p>
        Probability of improvement only looked at <em>how likely</em> is an improvement, but, shouldn't we be looking into <em>how much</em> we can improve? The next criterion called, Expected
        Improvement, (EI) does exactly that!
      </p>

      <p>
        In this acquisition function, <d-math>t + 1^{th}</d-math> query point, <d-math>x_{t+1}</d-math>, is selected according to the equation below.
      </p>
      <d-math block>
        x_{t+1} = argmin_x \mathbb{E} \left( ||f_{t+1}(x) - f(x^\star) || \ | \ \mathcal{D}_t \right)
      </d-math>
      <p>
        Where, <d-math>f</d-math> is the actual ground truth function, <d-math>f_{t+1}</d-math> is our GP posterior of the ground truth for <d-math>t+1^{th}</d-math> timestep, <d-math>\mathcal{D}_t</d-math> is the training data <d-math>\{(x_i, f(x_i))\} \ \forall x \in x_{1:t}</d-math> and <d-math>x^\star</d-math> is the actual position where the ground truth
        function takes the maximum value.
      </p>

      <p>
        In essence we are trying to select the point that minimizes the distance to the objective evaluated at the maximum. Unfortunately, we don't know the ground truth function, <d-math>f</d-math>. Mockus<d-cite key="mockusEI"></d-cite> proposed
        the following acquisition function to overcome the issue.
      </p>

      <d-math block>
        x_{t+1} = argmax_x \mathbb{E} \left( {max} \{ 0, \ f_{t+1}(x) - f(x^+) \} \ | \ \mathcal{D}_t \right)
      </d-math>

      <p>
        Where <d-math>f(x^+)</d-math> is the maximum value that has been encountered so far. This equation can be easily converted analytically to a closed form equation shown below.
      </p>

        EI(x)=

        (\mu_t(x) - f(x^+) - \epsilon)\Phi(Z) + \sigma_t(x)\phi(Z), & \text{if}\ \sigma_t(x) > 0 \\
        0 & \text{if}\ \sigma_t(x) = 0
        \end{cases}

        Z= \frac{\mu_t(x) - f(x^+) - \epsilon}{\sigma_t(x)}
      </d-math>
      <p>
        where <d-math>\Phi(\cdot)</d-math> indicates CDF and <d-math>\phi(\cdot)</d-math> indicates pdf.
      </p>
      <p>We can see when our <em>Expected Improvement</em> will be high.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>It is high when the expected value of <d-math>\mu_t(x) - f(x^+)</d-math> is high.</li>

        <li>It is high when the uncertainty <d-math>\sigma_t(x)</d-math> around a point is high.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Now, if we see the role of <d-math>\epsilon</d-math> in <em>Expected Improvement</em>, it is the exact same as the role played in the case of <em>Probability of Improvement</em> (we have the same expression in PI) <d-footnote>A good
          introduction to the Expected Improvement Acquisition function is by <a href="https://thuijskens.github.io/2016/12/29/bayesian-optimisation/" target="_blank">this post</a> by Thomas Huijskens and <a
            href="https://people.orie.cornell.edu/pfrazier/Presentations/2018.11.INFORMS.tutorial.pdf" target="_blank">these slides</a> by Peter Frazier</d-footnote>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like the Probability of Improvement's acquisition function, we can moderate the amount of explorability the Expected Improvement's acquisition function by setting the <d-math>\epsilon</d-math> hyperparameter.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/mab-gp-ei-eps0.01.gif" /></d-figure>
      </figure>

      <p>
        We see that having <d-math>\epsilon = 0.01</d-math> primarily results in exploitation, and we are not able to get to the global maxima due to this myopic drilling location selection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us try increasing the <d-math>\epsilon</d-math> variable to focus a little more on explorability.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/mab-gp-ei-eps1.5.gif" /></d-figure>
      </figure>
      <p>
        As we expected, increasing the value to <d-math>\epsilon = 1.5</d-math> makes the acquisition function explore more and exploit when the time comes. We see that it moves slowly once it reaches near the global maxima,
        trying
        to find the global maxima. In this case, the exploration is effectively helping us reach a higher functional value much earlier!
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us see if increasing <d-math>\epsilon</d-math> helps us more!
      </p>

      <figure>
        <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/mab-gp-ei-eps3.gif" /></d-figure>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Is this better than before? Turns out a yes and a no. We see that here we do too much exploration given the value of <d-math>\epsilon = 3</d-math>. Which results in early reaching something close to global maxima, but unfortunately we don't
        exploit to get more gains near the global maxima. We would have liked an acquisition function that tried to exploit a bit more after reaching somewhere close to the global maxima.
      </p>

      <h4 id="eipi-relation">PI vs. EI</h4>


        <p>
          We have seen two closely related methods, The <em>Probability of Improvement</em> and the <em>Expected Improvement</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the figure below, we have plotted the values for both policies' acquisition function's values below, for each of the possible locations. The graph shows the relation followed
          between
          EI and PI for when we have a single training point <d-math>(0.5, f(0.5))</d-math>.
        </p>

        <figure class="smaller-img">
          <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/Ei_Pi_graph/0.svg" /></d-figure>
        </figure>
        <p>
          We can see that the <d-math>\alpha_{EI}</d-math> has its maximum value corresponding to <d-math>\alpha_{PI}</d-math> close to 0.25. But, <d-math>\alpha_{PI}</d-math> has a maximum of around 0.375, for which <d-math>\alpha_{EI}</d-math>
          is low. Choosing a point with low <d-math>\alpha_{PI}</d-math> and high <d-math>\alpha_{EI}</d-math> means taking more risk, but getting a high reward.
          In other words, when reward is the same for multiple points (<d-math>\alpha_{EI}</d-math>), we should prioritize to choose the option with lesser risk (or higher <d-math>\alpha_{PI}</d-math>). And similarly,
          when
          the risks are the same (same <d-math>\alpha_{PI}</d-math>), we would want to go with points with greater reward (higher <d-math>\alpha_{EI}</d-math>).
        </p>

        <h3 id="gaussianprocessupperconfidenceboundgp_ucb">Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (GP-UCB)</h3>

        <p>
          Before talking about GP-UCB, let us quickly talk about <strong>regret</strong>. Imagine if the maximum gold was <d-math>a</d-math> units and our optimization instead samples a location containing <d-math>b < a</d-math> units, then our
              regret is <d-math>a -
              b</d-math>. If we accumulate the regret over <d-math>n</d-math> iterations, we get what is called <strong> cumulative regret. </strong> <br />

          GP-UCB is an interesting acquisition function as it gives us theoretical bounds on the convergence rates, or in other words, bounds the cumulative regret. Its formulation is given by:
        </p>

        <d-math block>
          \alpha_{GP-UCB}(x) = \mu_t(x) + \sqrt{\mathcal{v}\tau_t}\sigma_t(x)
        </d-math>
        <p>Where <d-math>t</d-math> is the timestep and <d-math>\tau_t</d-math> is,</p>
        <d-math block>
          \tau_t = 2log \left( \frac{t^{d/2 + 2}\pi^{2}}{3\delta} \right)
        </d-math>

        <p>
          We can see how this formulation looks fairly similar to the first vanilla acquisition function that we had described. The difference here compared to <em>UCB</em> is that the <d-math>\lambda</d-math> here is a function of the timestep <d-math>t</d-math>. This helps in some of the theoretical bounds which for which we would like to refer the original paper on <em>GP-UCB</em><d-cite key="gpucb"></d-cite>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/mab-gp-gp_ucb1-1.gif" /></d-figure>
        </figure>

        <p>
          We seem to be exploiting too much, let us increase the exploratory hyperparameters!
        </p>

        <figure>
          <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/mab-gp-gp_ucb3-1.gif" /></d-figure>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Using this set of hyperparameters, we are able to get near global maxima and further "exploit" to find the global maximum. This was a result of increasing the value of <d-math>v</d-math> to
          <d-math>3</d-math>. This shows that <d-math>v</d-math> gives weight to exploration.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/mab-gp-gp_ucb1-3.gif" /></d-figure>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Setting the values of the hyperparameters to <d-math>v = 1</d-math> and <d-math>\delta = 3</d-math> results in greater exploitation.</p>

        <h3 id="thompsonsampling">Thompson Sampling</h3>

        <p>One more acquisition function that is quite common is Thompson Sampling. It has a low overhead of setting up.</p>

        <p>
          The idea is to sample functions within upper and lower probabilistic bounds of a regressor. In other words, we sample functions from the learned Gaussian Process. Once we have sampled a function <d-math>h_t</d-math> for the <d-math>t^{th}
          </d-math> timestep, we choose point <d-math>x_{t+1}</d-math> that maximizes the function <d-math>h_t</d-math> as the next query point to be evaluated.
        </p>

          <figure>
            <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/posterior.svg" /></d-figure>
          </figure>
          

        <p>
          The intuition behind Thompson sampling can be understood by clearly noticing two important observations.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Locations <d-math>x</d-math> with high variance (<d-math>\sigma(x)</d-math>) will show a larger variance in the functional value of the sampled function. This might help in exploration as high variation might lead to the having the
                sampled functions more prone to having high value at locations with high variance. This will ensure an <strong>exploratory</strong> behaviour.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The current max value evaluated be denoted by <d-math>f(x^+)</d-math>. The sampled functions will need to pass through or closely from current max value (due to low <d-math>\sigma(x)</d-math>) at the evalutated locations. This will
                ensure a <strong>exploiting</strong> behaviour of the acquisition function.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Combining the above two observations, the acquisition function would accordingly do explorations and exploitation.
          </p>

            <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/mab-gp-thomp.gif" /></d-figure>
          </figure>

          <h3 id="random">Random</h3>

          <p>
            We had used intelligent acquisition functions earlier, let us see what happens if our acquisition function chooses randomly.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have here implemented a random method as a baseline. Notice, random method can find a location near the global maximum but is not able to exploit (try to find the global maxima that might be near this "best" location).
            Instead, it
            randomly chooses to explore the search space. Even with no intelligence, we might get good locations which might be close to the location with the most gold content.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/rand.gif" /></d-figure>

          <h3 id="piei_acq">Probability of Improvement + <d-math>\lambda \ \times</d-math> Expected Improvement (EI-PI)</h3>

          <p>
            Below we have tried to combine PI and EI using a linear combination as a combination of various acquisition function also results in an acquisition function. We can, therefore, combine any of the acquisition function and form a new one.
          </p>

          <P>
            One reason we might want to combine two methods is to overcome the limitations of the individual methods. Furthermore, since we combined the two acquisition functions, we also have individual hyperparameters included in this combined acquisition function. Let us list the final hyperparameters for ease:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <d-math>\epsilon_{PI}</d-math> -- Controls the <d-math>\epsilon</d-math> for <em>Probability of Improvement</em>.
              </li>
              <li>
                <d-math>\epsilon_{EI}</d-math> -- Controls the <d-math>\epsilon</d-math> for <em>Expected Improvement</em>.
              </li>
              <li>
                <d-math>\lambda</d-math> -- Controls the linear weightage given <em>Expected Improvement</em> over <em>Probability of Improvement</em>.
              </li>
          </P>

          <figure>
            <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/mab-gp-ei_pi.gif" /></d-figure>
          </figure>

          <h3 id="comparison">Comparison</h3>

     
          <p>
            Below we have a graph showing a comparison of different acquisition functions<d-footnote>To know more about the difference between acquisition functions look at <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/540-2013/lectures/l7.pdf">these</a> amazing slides from Nando De Freitas</d-footnote> discussed above. We have chosen the hyperparameters that gave us the best performance during our basic hyperparameter search.

            We had run the Random acquisition function several times with different seeds. We have plotted the mean and the standard deviation below. We can see the standard deviation (variance) is quite high, which is expected as we are randomly choosing points <d-math>x</d-math> to evaluate our black box function <d-math>f</d-math>.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/comp.svg" /></d-figure>
          </figure>

          <p>We see the <em>Random</em> method can find the maximum much before any of the other techniques; this can be seen when we are faced with smaller spaces. But we will soon see that when we have larger search spaces, a random
            method
            isn't
            that efficient. This is because the probability of finding the optimum <d-math>x</d-math> in our new <d-math>f</d-math> real-valued multivariable function would drop exponentially with increasing dimensions due to what we call,
            the
            curse of dimensionality.</p>

          <h1 id="generalization">Formalizing Bayesian Optimization</h1>

          <span>Let us now formally introduce Bayesian Optimization. Our goal is to find the <d-math>{x}</d-math> where we reached global maximum (or minimum) of a function <d-math>f: \mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R}</d-math>. Constraints in
            Bayesian Optimization look like below quoted from slides/talk
            <d-footnote>Talk from Peter Fraizer from Uber on Bayesian Optimization:<br>
              <ul>

              </ul>
            </d-footnote> on Tutorial on Bayesian Optimization from Peter Fraizer.</span>


          <p>We’d like to optimize <d-math>f: \mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R}</d-math>.<br></p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <d-math>f</d-math>’s feasible set <d-math>A</d-math> is simple,
              e.g., box constraints.
            </li>
            <li>
              <d-math>f</d-math> is continuous but lacks special structure,
              e.g., concavity, that would make it easy to optimize.
            </li>
            <li>
              <d-math>f</d-math> is derivative-free:
              evaluations do not give gradient information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <d-math>f</d-math> is expensive to evaluate:
              the number of times we can evaluate it
              is severely limited.
            </li>
            <li>
              <d-math>f</d-math> may be noisy. If noise is present, we’ll assume it
              is independent and normally distributed, with
              common but unknown variance.
            </li>
          </ul>


          <p>Let us link the above constraints to our initial problem statement of gold mining.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Our domain in the gold mining problem is a single dimensional box constraint of <d-math>0 \leq x \leq 6</d-math>.</li>

            <li>Our ground truth can be seen as neither convex nor concave function, which resulted in local minima as well.</li>

            <li>Our evaluation (by drilling) of the amount of gold content at a location didn't give us any gradient information.</li>

            <li>The function we used in the case of gold mining problem is extremely costly to evaluate (drilling costs millions).</li>

            <li>This constraint is still satisfied in our case as we had used 0 noise, or zero mean zero std gaussian noise.</li>
          </ul>
          <!--
    <h2 id="higherdimensions">Higher Dimensions</h2>

    <p>For now we have been looking at real-valued single dimensional function, i.e. <d-math>f: \mathbb{R} \texttt{ -> } \mathbb{R}</d-math> data where we needed to find the value of <d-math>\boldsymbol{x}</d-math> where we reached
      global
      maximum. Let's move on and try to tackle real-valued functions of <d-math>n</d-math> real variables functions, i.e. <d-math>f: \mathbb{R}^n \texttt{ -> } \mathbb{R}</d-math>. We will soon see that our methods that we saw earlier
      for
      the
      single dimensional case can be easily ported to multi-variable functions.</p>
    -->
          <h3 id="whyisthiseasier">Why is it easier to optimize the acquisition function?</h3>

          <p>One valid question one might come up is that we have replaced the original optimization problem (optimizing the given black-box function) to another optimization problem (optimization of acquisition function). How is this any better
            than the last problem? The main
            reason
            is
            that evaluating the acquisition function is much cheaper, whereas in the original problem, evaluating the value at a particular was extremely costly.</p>


          <h2 id="hyperparametersvsparameters">Hyperparameter Tuning</h2>

            <p>Before we talk about Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning<d-cite key="Snoek2012,NIPS2011_4443,Bergstra"></d-cite>, we will quickly differentiate between hyperparameters and parameters. </p>

            <p>
              Hyperparameters<d-footnote> For definitions visit the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning)">Hyperparameters</a>.</d-footnote> are parameters whose value is set before the learning process begins. Parameters, on the other hand, are the parameters that are learned looking at the data. One small example that we can think of can be of Ridge Regression. In Ridge Regression, we have the usual parameters, <d-math>W</d-math>: weight matrix, <d-math>c</d-math>: the intercept, both of which are learned from the data. We further have a hyperparameter we need to set to get regularization effect, the regularization coefficient <d-math>\lambda \geq 0</d-math>.
            </p>

            <p>Now as we are clear on the difference between hyperparameters and parameters we would like to introduce one of the most common use case of Bayesian Optimization; <em>Hyperparameter Tuning</em>: finding the best performing
              hyperparameters
              on machine learning models. At last, hyperparameter tuning is an optimization problem (optimizing our metric of choice).</p>

            <p>Usually, when training a model isn't expensive and time-consuming, we might just do a grid search. The main issue with grid search is that it is not feasible if getting the functional value is extremely costly, as in case of a large
              neural network that takes days to train. This might result in days of waiting to get the accuracy scores.



              <p>We turn to Bayesian optimization to find counter the expensiveness of getting the functional values, and these increased dimensions.</p>

              <h3 id="example1">Example 1</h3>

              <p>Let us us use an SVM on sklearn's moons dataset and try to find the optimal hyperparameter using Bayesian optimization. Let us have a look at the dataset first.</p>

              <p>
                Let us now try to learn the classification problem above using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). We are aware that a SVM takes in two important hyperparameters,
              </p>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <d-math>\gamma</d-math> -- modifies the behavior of the SVM's kernel. Intuitively it is a measure of how far the influence of a single training example reaches<d-footnote>Stackoverflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35848210/support-vector-machine-what-are-c-gamma">answer</a> for intuition behind the hyperparameters.</d-footnote>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <d-math>C</d-math> -- modifies the slackness of the classification, the higher the C is, the more sensitive is SVM towards the noise.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
                <p>
                  Let us apply Bayesian Optimization to learn the best hyperparameters for this classification task<d-footnote> <strong>Note</strong>: the surface plots you see for the Ground Truth Accuracies below were calculated for each possible hyperparameter for showcasing purposes only. We don't have these values in real applications.

              <p>
                Below we will compare the acquisition functions in finding the best hyperparameters for our SVM model. We had again ran the Random acquisition function several times with different seeds.

              <p>We see GP-UCB performed the best in this case. Random that was performing really nice in the last single dimensional example seems to perform much badly in this case. This can be attributed to the increase in the number of
                dimensions,
                it's much difficult to get to the optimal value by using random search.</p>

      <p>
        We will continue now to train a Random Forest on the moons dataset we had used previously to learn the Support Vector Machine. The main hyperparameters of Random Forests we would like to optimize our accuracy are <strong> number</strong> of Decision Trees we would like to have, <strong>maximum depth</strong> for each of those decision trees.

        The parameters of the Random Forest the individual Decision Trees that are formed.

        We see that the optimization is in two dimensions. Therefore it is expected that random would perform much worse than in the case of a single dimension.
      </p>

      <h3 id="example3">Example 3</h3>

      <p>
        Let us take this example to get an idea of how to apply Bayesian Optimization to training neural networks like CNNs on Mnist. Here we will be using <d-code language="python">scikit-optim</d-code>, which also provides us support for optimizing
        our function on a mix of categorical, integral, and real variables. We won't be plotting the ground truth here, as it's extremely costly to do so. Below are some code snippets that go into adding Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter
        tuning.
      </p>

      <p>
        The code below declares the search space for the optimization problem (hyperparameter tuning). In this example we are limiting the search space to be the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            batch_size -- Our search space for the possible batch sizes consists of integer values s.t. batch_size = <d-math>2^i \ \forall \ 2 \leq i \leq 7 \ \& \ i \in \mathbb{Z}</d-math>.<br />
            This hyperparameter sets the number of training examples to combine to find the gradients for a single step in gradient descent.
          </li>
          <li>
            learning rate -- We will be searching all the real numbers from the range <d-math>[10^{-6}, \ 1]</d-math>.<br />
            This hyperparamter sets the stepsize with which we will perform gradient descent in the neural network.
          </li>
          <li>
            activation -- We will have one categorical variable, i.e. the activation to apply to our neural network layers. This variable can take on values in the set <d-math>\{ relu, \ sigmoid \}</d-math>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <d-code block language="python">
        log_batch_size = Integer(
        low=2, 
        high=7, 
        name='log_batch_size'
        )
        lr = Real(
        low=1e-6,
        high=1e0,
        prior='log-uniform',
        name='lr'
        )
        activation = Categorical(
        categories=['relu', 'sigmoid'],
        name='activation'
        )

        dimensions = [
        dim_num_batch_size_to_base,
        dim_learning_rate,
        dim_activation
        ]
      </d-code>

      <p>
        Moving on, we have a minimizer function imported from <d-code language="python">scikit-optim</d-code> called <d-code language="python">gp-minimize</d-code>. One can easily change the acquisition function from a number of available options.
        Below we have a code snippet showing the calling of the optimization function with the <em>Expected Improvement</em> acquisition function.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>: One will need to negate the accuracy values as we are using the minimizer function from <d-code language="python">scikit-optim</d-code>.
      </p>

      <d-code block language="python">
        # setting up default parameters (1st point)
        default_parameters = [4, 1e-1, 'relu']

        # bayesian optimization
        search_result = gp_minimize(
        func=train,
        dimensions=dimensions,
        acq_func='EI', # Expected Improvement.
        n_calls=11,
        x0=default_parameters
        )
      </d-code>

      <figure class="smaller-img">
        <d-figure><img src="images/MAB_gifs/conv.svg"></d-figure>
      </figure>
      
      <p>      
        There you go you now have the hyperparameters that have maximized your accuracy. In the graph above the y-axis denotes the <d-math>\left( f(x^+) \right)</d-math> and the x-axis denotes the number of times we have queried <d-math>(t)</d-math> the Neural Network with some set of given hyperparameters.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can easily apply the BO for more dimensions (more hyperparameters), even if the dimensions which are categorical (as 'relu' vs 'sigmoid' above) can easily be incorporated into BO.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at the above example, we can see that incorporating Bayesian Optimization isn't a big problem and saves a lot of time we can see that the network was able to get to an accuracy of nearly one in around three iterations. That's impressive! The example above has been inspired by Hvass Laboratories' Tutorial<d-footnote> <a href="https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/19_Hyper-Parameters.ipynb">Notebook</a> showcasing hyperparameter optimization in Tensorflow. </d-footnote> on <d-code language="python">scikit-optim</d-code>.
      </p>

      <h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>

      <p>
        We see that for the case of Bayesian optimization, we have a different problem that we are trying to solve compared to the active learning problem. This, therefore, leads to different objective functions that we try to maximize for the query
        points in both of the problems.

            <p>
              While working on the blog, we once scaled the accuracy from the range <d-math>[0, \ 1]</d-math> to <d-math>[0, \ 100]</d-math>. This changed broke havoc as the Gaussian Processes we were using had certain hyperparameters, which needed to be scaled with the accuracy to maintain scale invariance. We wanted to point this out as it might be helpful for the readers who would like to start using on BO.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We need to take care while using Bayesian Optimization. Bayesian Optimization based on Gaussian Processes Regression is highly sensitive to the kernel used. For example, if you are using <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels.Matern.html">Matern</a> kernel, we are implicitly assuming that the function we are trying to optimize is first order differentiable.

          <li>
            <p>
              Searching for the hyperparameters, and the choice of the acquisition function to use in BO are interesting problems in themselves. There has been amazing work done, looking at this problem. As mentioned previously in the post, there has been work done in strategies using multiple acquisition function<d-cite key="multiACQ"></d-cite> to deal with these interesting issues.

<h1 id="bayesianoptimizationvsgradientdescent">Bayesian Optimization vs. Gradient Descent</h1>

<p>Some of the main differences between BO and GD as pointed out at StackExchange<d-cite key="BOvsGD"></d-cite>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The biggest difference between Bayesian Optimization and Gradient Descent is that in the latter case, we have access to the gradient values.</li>

  <li>BO doesn't assume the function to be convex, in the case of Gradient Descent if you would like to get to the global minima, your function should be convex.</li>

  <li>BO assumes the function we are optimizing is fairly smooth.</li>

  <li>BO doesn't scale well with large data, as the GP inference is cubic in the number of points.</li>
</ul>

<p>There has been work done in Bayesian Optimization to make use of gradient information. The idea is based on the fact that the Gaussian Processes' predictions can be updated to take in the gradient information we get from the
  function
  we are trying to optimize. For more information, we would suggest looking at the paper Bayesian Optimization with Gradients<d-cite key="BOwtGD"></d-cite> from Wu et. al..</p>

<p>Now, as we have described BO more technically, let's have a look at how we can use this method in the case of Hyperparameter Tuning. Hyperparameters, you ask?</p>
